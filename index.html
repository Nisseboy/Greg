  <div class="info-box">Specify the inputs and outputs of every machine, right click on the canvas or on machines to add new machines. Machines don't need inputs for example an infinite water source or cobblestone generator. They don't need outputs either, if a machine doesn't have an output it is considered a must to fulfill it's input and the rest of the machines will have the required amount of LV, MV, HV etc required calculated based on that. You don't have to name your machines but it's easier to keep track of it then, the same goes for the resources, only the amounts, energy usage and time are necessary.</div>
